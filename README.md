This is a toy project designed to implement randomization in survey experiments. Although commercial survey platforms already offer relatively advanced randomization services, the existing options may not fully meet researchers' needs for executing complex randomization operations in survey experiments. This project provides a solution for complex randomization by enabling random redirection through pre-generated survey links. In the current version, respondents can participate in the survey simply by visiting [https://andypku.github.io/survey/](https://andypku.github.io/survey/).
