This is a toy project designed to implement randomization in survey experiments. Although commercial survey platforms already offer relatively advanced randomization services, the existing options may not fully meet researchers' needs for executing complex randomization operations in survey experiments. This project provides a solution for complex randomization by enabling random redirection through pre-generated survey links. GitHub Pages provides convenience for researchers to host survey randomization links, allowing respondents to participate in the survey simply by visiting "https://{researcher's GitHub ID}.github.io/{project name}". Additionally, `generate_qr.py` can convert survey links into QR codes, making it easier for respondents to complete the survey on mobile devices.
