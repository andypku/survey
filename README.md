This is a toy project designed to implement randomization in survey experiments. Although commercial survey platforms already offer relatively advanced randomization services, the existing options may not fully meet researchers' needs for executing complex randomization operations in survey experiments. This project provides a solution for complex randomization by enabling random redirection through pre-generated survey links. In the current version, respondents can participate in the survey simply by visiting [https://andypku.github.io/survey/](https://andypku.github.io/survey/).

This project was originally developed to support a survey experiment pre-registered at [https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/72YT3](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/72YT3). Since the experiment was conducted in China, the language used for both the survey and the randomization links is Chinese. Additionally, `generate_qr.py` can convert survey links into QR codes, making it easier for respondents to complete the survey on mobile devices.
